            The Arweave network is like Bitcoin, but for data: A permanent and
            decentralized web inside an open ledger.

          <p class="pt-4">
            The Arweave protocol is stable, mature and widely adopted. As such,
            its ecosystem is fully decentralized. This site is just the tip of
            the iceberg. It acts as a map that points you to places you can
            learn about, use and build on Arweave.<br /> Dive in! The rabbit hole
            is deep, and the possibilities are endless.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-4">
            Permanent storage has many applications: from the preservation of
            humanity's most important data, to the hosting of truly
            decentralized and provably neutral web apps.
