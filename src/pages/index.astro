        Meet Arweave:

          The Arweave network is like Bitcoin, but for data: A permanent and
          decentralized web inside an open ledger.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Permanent storage has many applications: from the preservation of
          humanity&apos;s most important data, to the hosting of truly
          decentralized and provably neutral web apps.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          The Arweave protocol is stable, mature and widely adopted. As such,
          its ecosystem is fully decentralized. This site is just the tip of the
          iceberg. It acts as a map that points you to places you can learn
          about, use and build on Arweave.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Dive in! The rabbit hole is deep, and the possibilities are endless.
