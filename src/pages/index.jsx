            The Arweave network is like Bitcoin, but for data: An entire web
            inside a decentralized, provably neutral and open ledger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only does the Arweave network permanently store all of
            humanityâ€™s important digital artifacts, but it can even be used to
            host fully decentralized and provably neutral web apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Arweave protocol is complete, mature and widely adopted. As
            such, its ecosystem is fully decentralized. This site is just the
            tip of the iceberg. It acts as a map that points you to places you
            can use, learn about, and build on Arweave.

            Dive in! The rabbit hole is deep, and the possibilities are endless.
